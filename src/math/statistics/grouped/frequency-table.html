            <h2>What is a Frequency Table?</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine you have collected a lot of data, like the test scores of 100 students.
                Looking at a long list of numbers can be confusing and hard to understand.
                A <strong>frequency table</strong> helps us organize this data by showing how often each value, or a range of values, appears.
            </p>
            <p>
                For <strong>grouped data</strong>, instead of listing every single score, we group scores into "classes" or "intervals." This is especially useful when dealing with continuous data or a very wide range of discrete values.

        <section class="content-block">
            <h2>Key Components of a Grouped Frequency Table</h2>
            <p>A typical grouped frequency table includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Class Intervals:</strong> These are the ranges into which the data is grouped (e.g., 60-69, 70-79).</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The number of data points that fall within each class interval.</li>
                <li><strong>Relative Frequency:</strong> The proportion of the total data that falls into each class. It's calculated as (Class Frequency / Total Number of Data Points). Often expressed as a decimal or percentage.</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative Frequency:</strong> The running total of frequencies. It shows how many data points are below the upper limit of a given class.</li>
                <li><strong>Class Mark (Midpoint):</strong> The middle value of a class interval. It's calculated as (Lower Limit + Upper Limit) / 2. Useful for calculations like the mean of grouped data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Construct a Grouped Frequency Table (Step-by-Step)</h2>
            <p>Let's say we have a dataset of student test scores ranging from 55 to 98.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Determine the Range of the Data:</strong>
                    The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.
                    <p>Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Decide on the Number of Classes (k):</strong>
                    There's no strict rule, but usually between 5 and 20 classes. Too few can hide details, too many can be overwhelming.
                    A common guideline is to use $k \approx \sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the total number of data points.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Calculate the Class Width (w):</strong>
                    This determines the size of each interval. Always round up to ensure all data is covered.
                    <p>Class Width (w) = Range / Number of Classes (k)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Establish Class Limits:</strong>
                    Start with the minimum value or a convenient number slightly below it for the first lower class limit. Add the class width to find the lower limit of the next class, and so on.
                    Make sure classes are mutually exclusive (no overlaps) and exhaustive (cover all data).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tally the Frequencies:</strong>
                    Go through your raw data and count how many observations fall into each class interval.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Calculate Relative and Cumulative Frequencies (Optional):</strong>
                    Once frequencies are tallied, you can easily compute the relative and cumulative frequencies.
                </li>

            <h2>Example: Student Test Scores</h2>
            <p>Suppose we have the following 20 test scores:</p>
            <p class="data-list">
                55, 60, 63, 67, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 81, 83, 85, 87, 88, 90, 92, 95, 96, 97, 98
            </p>
            <p>Let's construct a frequency table with 5 classes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> $98 - 55 = 43$</li>
                <li><strong>Number of Classes (k):</strong> 5 (given)</li>
                <li><strong>Class Width (w):</strong> $43 / 5 = 8.6 \rightarrow$ round up to 9</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, let's create the table:</p>
            <table class="frequency-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Class Interval</th>
                        <th>Class Mark (x)</th>
                        <th>Frequency (f)</th>
                        <th>Relative Frequency</th>
                        <th>Cumulative Frequency</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>55 - 63</td>
                        <td>59</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>$3/20 = 0.15$</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>64 - 72</td>
                        <td>68</td>
                        <td>3</td>
                        <td>$3/20 = 0.15$</td>
                        <td>$3+3 = 6$</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>73 - 81</td>
                        <td>77</td>
                        <td>4</td>
                        <td>$4/20 = 0.20$</td>
                        <td>$6+4 = 10$</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>82 - 90</td>
                        <td>86</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>$5/20 = 0.25$</td>
                        <td>$10+5 = 15$</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>91 - 99</td>
                        <td>95</td>
                        <td>5</td>
                        <td>$5/20 = 0.25$</td>
                        <td>$15+5 = 20$</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
                <tfoot>
                    <tr>
                        <td colspan="2">Total</td>
                        <td>20</td>
                        <td>1.00</td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                </tfoot>
            </table>
            <p>
                From this table, we can quickly see that 25% of students scored between 82 and 90, and 75% of students scored 90 or below (from cumulative frequency). This makes large datasets much easier to understand!
