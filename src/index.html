    <h1>Welcome to EduProject</h1>

    <p>
        EduProject is designed to provide high school knowledge based on the Vietnamese curriculum,
        but presented in English. Why English? Because most scientific literature, programming documentation,
        and modern academic resources are in English. Learning in English ensures you can access knowledge directly
        without translation loss, preparing you for higher education, research, and international collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our teaching philosophy follows the principles of academic rebuttal and scientific reasoning.
        Every concept is explained systematically, evidence is provided, and interactive examples are used whenever possible.
        We encourage questioning, testing hypotheses, and active learning to develop critical thinking skills.
